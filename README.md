# FRITZ_OS_WebGUI_Login

Python code to log into a FRITZ!Box 

This is the code from the
["Logging in to the FRITZ!Box Web Interface" PDF](https://avm.de/fileadmin/user_upload/Global/Service/Schnittstellen/AVM_Technical_Note_-_Session_ID_english_2021-05-03.pdf)
from AVM.

It doesn't seem to be available anywhere as a
Python script, so I copied it out of the PDF
and cleaned it up for you.

If you intend to use this code then I suggest to
consider what you need it for. Because the Fritz!Box'es
offer a TR-064/UPnP API, that's more straightforward to use,
see [here](https://github.com/tpo/renew-letsencrypt-certificate-on-synology-behind-fritzbox)
for an example of how to use Fritzbox' TR-064/UPnP API.
